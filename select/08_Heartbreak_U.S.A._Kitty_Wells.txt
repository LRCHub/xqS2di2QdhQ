Back home in Heartbreak U.S.A.

The harbor's empty, my love has gone
With aching heart I face each cold and lonely dawn
And 'til the trade winds bring him home to stay
I'll live in Heartbreak U.S.A.

Don't let those Geisha girls get your heart in a whirl
(Please don't let 'em, please don't let 'em)
And if you meet some sweet Fraulein, remember you're mine
Don't forget your sweetheart while you're away
Back home in Heartbreak U.S.A.

Sometimes I'm lonely and time stands still
And I wonder if you feel the way I always will
So darling, write me letters every day
In care of Heartbreak U.S.A.

Don't let those Geisha girls get your heart in a whirl
(Please don't let 'em, please don't let 'em)
And if you meet some sweet Fraulein, remember you're mine
Don't forget your sweetheart while you're away
Back home in Heartbreak U.S.A.
