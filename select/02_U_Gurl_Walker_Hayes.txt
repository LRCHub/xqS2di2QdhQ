Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We sit out there on that porch swing
Don't phase you that it's pouring rain
And I kinda like that you ain't afraid
To get mud on your boots (okay)
Get sideways to that George Strait
Keep backing up that tailgate
Trucker hat, hundred proof
Guys like me like girls that look like
You girl
Cherry bottom boom girl
Every shade of blue jeans look mean with a body like that
Woo woo girl
Southern through and through girl
Do what you do girl (ooh-ooh)
Guys like me like girls that look like you girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
So the way you walk is suggestive
Strip mall town impressive
Girl, I hate to see you go (hold up)
But I love to watch you exit (ooh)
All flames where you cookin' at
That bourbon kiss where you putting that
I know it's rude to stare, but shoot
I don't wanna stop looking at
You girl
Cherry bottom boom girl
Every shade of blue jeans look mean with a body like that
Woo woo girl
Southern through and through girl
Do what you do girl
Guys like me like girls that look like you girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (ooh girl)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Guys like me like girls that look like you girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy
Brown eyes like two hurricanes
Lasso me with them hoop earrings
Moving me with the way you move
Guys like me like girls that look like
You girl (woo)
Cherry bottom boom girl
Every shade of blue jeans look mean with a body like that
Woo woo girl
Southern through and through girl
Do what you do girl (ooh)
Guys like me like girls that look like you girl
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
